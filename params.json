{"name":"Indra's IS429 Assignment 2","tagline":"Big Data Processing Tutorial","body":"### Welcome to Cloud & Big Data Tutorial.\r\nThis is a tutorial for processing large datasets that can only be processed with high computational power that is cloud. In this tutorial we are going to use Amazon Elastic Map Reducer (EMR), an amazingly powerful data processing service provided by Amazon Web Service. By following this tutorial, you can harness the power of cloud for processing big data in a matter of minutes.\r\nThis tutorial is divided into three parts, namely:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Configuring EC2 and Security Credentials\r\n- Setting up S3\r\n- Running EMR\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run this tutorial, you will need to sign up for [AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com). \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
