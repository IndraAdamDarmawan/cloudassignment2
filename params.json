{"name":"Indra's IS429 Assignment 2","tagline":"Big Data Processing Tutorial","body":"### Welcome to Cloud & Big Data Tutorial.\r\nThis is a tutorial for processing large datasets that can only be processed with high computational power that is cloud. In this tutorial we are going to use Amazon Elastic MapReducer (EMR), an amazingly powerful data processing service provided by Amazon Web Service. By following this tutorial, you can harness the power of cloud for processing big data in a matter of minutes.\r\nThis tutorial is divided into three parts, namely:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Configuring EC2 and Security Credentials\r\n- Setting up S3\r\n- Running EMR\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run this tutorial, you will need to sign up for [AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com). \r\n\r\n### Configuring EC2 and Security Credentials\r\nTo be able to run the Elastic MapReducer smoothly, we will need to make sure that EC2 and Security Credentials are configured correctly.\r\n\r\nCreate EC2 Key Pair:\r\n1. Go to your [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)\r\n2. Click on EC2 icon\r\n3. Click on Key Pair\r\n4. Click on Create Key Pair and give a unique name for it\r\n5. Save the private key to your computer\r\n\r\nConfigure Security Credentials\r\n1. Click on Security Credentials tab under you account name on the top right\r\n2. Click on the Access Key tab under Access Credentials\r\n3. Make sure there is an access key inside or create new one if you don't have any\r\n\r\n### Setting up S3\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
